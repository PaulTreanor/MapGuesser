# Mapguesser.com 

[mapguesser.com](https://www.mapguesser.com/) is a game where you are asked to show exactly where a place is on a map. 

Scores are based on how far your guess is from the city's real location, so lower scores are better. There is 5 rounds per game and you want your final score as close to 0 as possible, like golf.
